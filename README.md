#### Frontend: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/850e2715-bf55-4cba-9e59-e0ade1886258/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hackerelm/deploys)

An application built to serve up information on movies at your fingertips. Kind of like IMDb, but with way less features, information, and functionality.

Built with Elm on the frontend and Crystal on the backend.
